<h1 align="center">Recursion Tree Visualizer</h1>

<p align="center">Tool for visualizing any generic recursive function written in JavaScript or Python.</p>

## Overview

Watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/1f-KeeN8AHs) or check out the [live project](https://recursion.now.sh).

> Recursion is a concept that is best understood through visualization. This visualization tool written in TypeScript (with React and Node JS Express), will allow you to see visualization of different kinds of recursions. For simplicity, I chose to animate recursive functions using trees.
>
> Properties of the recursion tree visualizations are:
>
> - Each node represents a single recursive function call.
> - The height of the recursion tree is the depth of our function call stack (n).
> - The rate of change of the treeâ€™s width represents the time complexity of our function (m):

### Folders structure

- `packages/web`: react user interface.
- `packages/server`: server to execute user-defined code remotely.
<!-- - `packages/common`: shared code between web and lambda -->

## Local development

### Web

In the `packages/web` directory, run:

```bash
# to install all dependencies
$ npm install

# to run the app on localhost
$ npm run start
```

### Server

In the `packages/server` directory, run:

```bash
# to install all dependencies
$ npm install

# to run the app on localhost
$ npm run serve
```

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Drawing Presentable Trees](https://llimllib.github.io/pymag-trees/#foot5) and [Improving Walker's Algorithm to Run in Linear Time](http://dirk.jivas.de/papers/buchheim02improving.pdf) articles I implemented Reingold-Tilford's algorithm to position each node of the tree on a 2D plane in an aesthetically pleasing way.

## Compatibility

For a better experience, I recommend using a chromium-based browser like Chrome or Edge.
